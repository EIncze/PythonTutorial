    "Python is an easy to use but powerful programming language. Over the years, it has gained popularity in the data science crowd leading to many specialised tools being developed in Python. While this tutorial will attempt to cover the basics, many concepts will inevitably have to be left out. A great place to learn more is [the official tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks are hybrid documents that can contain code, outputs, and narrative, organised in cells. They have become almost synonymous with data science, particularly as teaching materials, due to their ability to weave code with immediate outputs and explanations written in markdown. \n",
    "Outputs can be printouts or plots, and each cell's outputs display immediately underneath it. Plots can even be made interactive, with the right libraries.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note** that by default, outputs are stored in the Notebook so whoever has access to the file can also see these outputs unless they are cleared before sending.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a more in-depth look at all the things that Jupyter Notebooks can do, there is no better place to start than the [official documentation](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/ipython/ipython-in-depth/HEAD?urlpath=tree/binder/Index.ipynb).\n",
